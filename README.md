## Problem Title
SIH 25006: Development of a Digital Farm Management Portal for implementing Biosecurity measures in Pig and Poultry Farms
## Problem Description
### Background

Biosecurity is critical in managing animal health, especially in pig and poultry farming, to prevent the spread of devastating diseases such as Avian Influenza and African Swine Fever. Smallholder farmers often lack access to actionable information and tools needed to implement effective biosecurity protocols, which jeopardizes animal health, food security, and their livelihoods.

### Problem Description

Farmers require an easy-to-use digital platform that supports the implementation and monitoring of farm-level biosecurity measures. This platform should enable risk assessment customized to local conditions, provide training and guidelines, support compliance with regulatory standards, deliver real-time alerts on disease outbreaks, and foster collaboration among farmers, veterinarians, and extension workers.

### Expected Outcomes

• Enhanced farmer awareness and education on biosecurity.
• Improved risk management at the farm level as well as self-assessment.
• Easy access to customized biosecurity protocols and guidelines.
• Digital record-keeping and compliance tracking.
• Timely alerts and disease notifications to farmers.
• Healthier livestock and increased farm productivity.
• Empowerment of small and marginal farmers with limited resources.
• Support to authorities in data-driven surveillance and policy making.
• Stronger collaboration across the livestock ecosystem.
• Improved national preparedness for zoonotic and transboundary diseases.

## Proposed Solution

We propose developing a mobile-first and multilingual digital portal that empowers farmers with:

Customizable risk assessment tools reflecting local epidemiology.

Interactive training modules and best practice guidelines for biosecurity.

Compliance tracking aligned with relevant regulatory frameworks.

Real-time alerts and notification dashboards to inform farmers about disease threats.

Collaboration tools connecting stakeholders for shared knowledge and support.

This solution will enhance disease prevention, improve farm productivity, and support authorities in data-driven policymaking.

## Technical Approach

We will build the portal using a responsive web framework such as React or Angular for front-end and Node.js or Python (Django/Flask) for back-end.

A cloud-based database (e.g., PostgreSQL) will store user, compliance, and outbreak data.

Risk assessment algorithms will be developed based on epidemiological inputs from authoritative sources.

Mobile accessibility and multilingual support will be prioritized to ensure adoption in rural areas.

Notifications will be implemented using push notification services and real-time dashboards.

The platform architecture will follow modular design principles with clear APIs for integration and scalability.

## Feasibility and Viability

Potential challenges include reliable internet access in rural regions and user adoption rates.

To address these, offline capabilities and SMS-based alerts are considered.

Training and support modules within the platform will help farmers adapt.

Leveraging open-source technologies and cloud infrastructure will keep development costs manageable.

Collaboration with local agricultural authorities will enhance credibility and dissemination.

## Impact and Benefits


Empower farmers with accessible biosecurity knowledge and tools.

Improve risk management and compliance with industry standards.

Enable early detection and rapid response to disease outbreaks.

Support healthier livestock and increase productivity and income.

Aid policymakers with real-time data and analytics for effective disease control.

Foster resilient farming communities through networking and resource sharing.
